# Weather App in Java

## Demo
To demo the program, you either clone the whole project and run the ```weather-app.exe``` in the project folder <br>
or just download the executable [weather-app.exe](https://github.com/josefswadijohansson/weatherapp-java/blob/main/weather-app.exe) and run it.

You need to have Java on your system for the executable to work.

## Development language, tools, SDKs, and API:s, etc.
- Java
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)

## So what is this project?
The end goal for this project was to develop a program where you input a city name, and it output the current temperature and some forecast for upcoming days.

I hadn't touched Java before, i have mostly written code in C# so this was way to test out the language too, using the basics of the language and using data from multiple APIs.

## Possible further development on it
- Have it use a GUI library to get a more "Windows" look it, rather than a CLI program for now.
